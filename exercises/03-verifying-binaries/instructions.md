1. Create the directory named `kubernetes-bin`. Navigate to the directory.
2. Run the script `setup.sh`. It will download the Kubernetes binaries for Linux AMD64.
3. Inspect the downloaded files.
4. Verifying that the downloaded binaries are compatible with the Kubernetes version 1.23.5 by comparing them with the corresponding checksum files.
